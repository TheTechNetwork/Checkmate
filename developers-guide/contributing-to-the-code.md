# Contributing to the code

We generally follow the [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow model.  If you’re not familiar with it, the general steps are

1. Create a feature branch in your local depository and make your changes.
2. Push your branch to the remote repository on Github.
3. Open a pull request.
4. The rest of the team will review the pull request and either approve or request changes.
5. If changes are requested, make changes and push.
6. Project maintainer will merge the branch, closing the pull request and deleting the remote branch.

# Welcome to Uptime Manager

Checkmate is an open-source, self-hosted tool designed to track and monitor server hardware, uptime, response times, and incidents in real-time with beautiful visualizations.

It uses [Capture](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture) to get data from remote servers and doesn't need anything other than the Checkmate server itself to monitor uptime and page speed.

## Demo

We have a [demo](https://checkmate-demo.bluewavelabs.ca) where you can test how the Uptime Manager works. The username is **uptimedemo@demo.com** and the password is **Demouser1!**

## Questions & ideas

If you have a question, head over to GitHub's [discussions](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/bluewave-uptime/discussions) page.  We also have a [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/NAb6H3UTjK) where you can also ask your questions or provide comments and suggestions.
